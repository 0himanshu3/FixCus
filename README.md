# FixCus

FixCus is a citizen-centric issue reporting and municipal operations platform that connects residents with their local government. It enables citizens to report civic issues (with images, video, geolocation and voice input), lets municipal staff manage and resolve those issues using task assignments and escalations, and provides AI-assisted tools for categorization and feedback summarization.

* **Feedback & AI Summaries**

  * After resolution, citizens and staff can submit feedback.
  * AI generates concise feedback summaries from the final supervisor response and collected feedback.

* **Heatmap & Geospatial Tools**

  * All issues are geocoded and visualized on an interactive heatmap for trend analysis and hotspot detection.

* **Timelines & Auditing**

  * Comprehensive timeline tracking every action an issue experiences from creation to closure (assignment, updates, approvals, escalations).

* **Role-specific Dashboards**

  * Each major role (Citizen, Staff, Coordinator, Supervisor, Municipality Admin) has a tailored dashboard showing relevant KPIs and actionable items.
